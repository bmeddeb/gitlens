# GitLens

**GitLens** is a Python library (with Rust under the hood) for analyzing Git repositories at scale. Its primary goals include efficient handling of large repositories, extensive GitHub integration, and a powerful analysis framework for code, issues, pull requests, and more. Whether you need quick insights into your repository or deep analytics on code history and contributor behavior, GitLens aims to be your go-to solution.

## Why GitLens?

1. **Scale**: Large codebases pose unique challenges that many Git tools fail to address efficiently.
2. **Performance**: Written in Rust, exposed in Python. You get a Pythonic interface without sacrificing execution speed.
3. **Advanced Analytics**: From commit history traversal to predictive analysis for bugs and hotspots, GitLens provides a full spectrum of insights.
4. **GitHub-Centric**: Native GitHub API support to augment repository data with pull requests, issues, and more.
