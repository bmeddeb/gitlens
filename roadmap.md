# GitLens Read-Only Git Analysis: Feature Overview

**Note**: This library focuses solely on *analysis* and *read-only* operations. It does **not** perform any write, commit, or destructive actions on the repository.

---

## Core Analysis Features

### Commit Management
- **Commit History Traversal**: Navigate commits chronologically or via topological order
- **Filtering**: Query commits by author, date range, or message content

### Branch Operations
- **Branch Tracking Information**: Retrieve branch ahead/behind counts and upstream data
- **Merge Analysis**: Examine historical merge commits and merge strategies (no actual merging performed)
- **Branch Ancestry Mapping**: Visualize and analyze branch lineage

### Worktree Insights
- **List Worktrees**: Enumerate existing worktrees associated with a repository

### Index / Staging Inspection
- **View Staged Changes**: Inspect what’s currently staged (no staging/unstaging actions)

### Config Management (Read-Only)
- **Read Repository Config**: Access local and global Git settings
- **Iterate Configuration**: Enumerate config keys and values

### Submodule Handling
- **Status Reporting**: Inspect submodule states and paths
- **Recursive Analysis**: Traverse submodule hierarchies for analysis

### References
- **Symbolic References**: Examine HEAD, tags, and other reference pointers
- **Reflog Inspection**: Read reference logs (reflog) to track commit movements
- **Reference Enumeration**: List and analyze all refs in a repository

### Ignore Rules
- **Parse `.gitignore`**: Determine which files or paths are ignored

### Credentials & Authentication
- **Read-Only Access**: Handle basic authentication for clone/fetch operations (if needed)

## Repository Analysis

- **Contribution Statistics**: Count commits per author and track contributions over time
- **Code Ownership Mapping**: Identify which files or directories are predominantly owned by specific contributors
- **Change Frequency**: Highlight files or directories that change most often
- **Branch Divergence Metrics**: Compare branches to determine how far they’ve diverged

---

## Advanced Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel Commit Traversal**: Speed up read operations over large commit histories
- **Parallel Blame Calculations**: Quickly determine line-by-line authorship

### Specialized Operations
- **Merge Base Detection**: Find the common ancestor(s) of branches
- **Rename Detection**: Identify file renames throughout history
- **Common Ancestor Finding**: Compare multiple commits or branches
- **Bisect Assistance**: Automate read-only steps in a bisect process

### Content Filtering
- **Clean/Smudge Filter Awareness**: Interpret how Git transforms files on checkout/commit
- **Git Attributes Support**: Read attribute-based behaviors for files

### Large File Handling
- **Git LFS Compatibility**: Recognize and reference large files stored via LFS (no write operations)
- **Chunked File Reading**: Efficiently read large binary files

### Signature Verification
- **GPG Signature Checks**: Verify the authenticity of signed commits or tags

### Advanced Comparison
- **Three-Way Merging Analysis**: Compare how merges were constructed (no merges performed)
- **Directory Comparison**: Identify differences between directories at specific commits
- **Identical File Detection**: Spot duplicate file content across revisions

### Notes (Read-Only)
- **Existing Git Notes**: Read and analyze attached notes without modification

### Shallow Clones
- **Read-Only Shallow Repositories**: Analyze partial or shallow-cloned repos without deepening them

### Branch Policies
- **Protected Branch Checks**: Validate if certain branches meet configured protection rules (read-only)

### GitHub / GitLab Integration (Read-Only)
- **API Interaction**: Collect metadata from PRs/MRs and issues without creating or modifying them
- **Issue Linking**: Analyze commit-to-issue relationships

### Git Protocol Implementation
- **Smart Protocol Client (Read-Only)**: Fetch repository data without pushing changes
- **Custom Transports**: Specialized read-only retrieval mechanisms

### Visualization Helpers
- **Commit Graph Generation**: Produce data for commit or branch graphs
- **Network Visualization Data**: Export structures for external visualization tools
- **Branch Topology Mapping**: Illustrate complex branch relationships

**All of these features are designed exclusively for *analysis and observation*, ensuring no modifications to the target repository.**
